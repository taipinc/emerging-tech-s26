# Assignment 1: Procedural Photography

Write an algorithm (a set of instructions) that another person will execute to create a photographic work. Think of your algorithm as a photographic "machine" - when someone follows your instructions, they should produce a cohesive body of images or photo-based documentation.

During class-time next week (week 3), another student will receive and execute your instructions (while you execute someone else's).

Due to the cold weather, the instructions must be directed at interior spaces. You can direct the 'executioner' to different university buildings close by.

**Requirements:**

- Executing your instructions should fit within **30 minutes** of duration
- Must produce a series of digital photographs (using the smartphone camera)
- Must include **ONE** of these algorithmic elements:
  - Loops (repetition with variation)
  - Conditions (if/then logic based on what's encountered)

**Your procedure can utilize:**

- Available infrastructure (buildings, public spaces)
- Found resources (signs, people, objects encountered)

**Safety & Ethics:**

- Don't put anyone at risk
- Respect privacy and private property
- Consider the impact on subjects and locations

A few examples with ==notes== for the reader!

## Example 1

- Go to the University Center Library
- Repeat for 30 minutes: [==this is a loop==]
  - Look for unshelved books
  - Upon finding an unshelved book 
    - Take a picture of where the book was found
    - Take a picture of its cover
    - Take a picture of a random page
    - If the book has an image on its cover: [==this is a CONDITION==]
      - Google Search using the image, take a screenshot of the results
    - If the book doesn't have an image on its cover:
      - Use ChatGPT or Google Gemini to generate an image, using the book's title as the prompt
  - Repeat

## Example 2

- Go to the building's ground floor, wait by the elevators
- For 30 minutes, repeat: [==this is a loop==]
  - Follow the 1st person to go into the elevator
  - In the elevator, while full, **take one pictures** of the entire floor (including people's shoes)
  - Follow the last person to leave the elevator
  - Upon exiting, **take a quick picture** of the elevator's back wall
  - Follow the person till they reach their destination
    - If they entered a classroom: [==this is a CONDITION==]
      - **Take a picture** of the classroom's number sign
    - If they didn't enter a classroom: [==another CONDITION==]
      - Ask if you can **take a picture** of a pattern they have (clothes, bags, anything they carry)
  - Go back to the elevators, or another set of elevators in the same building, start over (without going to ground floor)
