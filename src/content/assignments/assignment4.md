# Assignment 4: Remote Investigation

Choose a location that has personal significance to you - somewhere you've lived, a place from your family history, somewhere you've never been but want to understand. Investigate this place using only remote sensing technologies and online sources. Create a visual documentation of what you find and what remains hidden.

**Use at least 3 different remote sensing sources:**
- Satellite imagery (Google Earth, Sentinel Hub, Planet Labs archives)
- Street-level imagery (Google Street View, Mapillary)
- Archival sources (historical maps, aerial photos)
- Webcams, traffic cameras, publicly accessible feeds
- Social media geotagged imagery
- Any other "remote" view of the place

**Consider:**
- What are you trying to find out?
- What does each source reveal?
- What surprise you or contradict other sources?
- What remained invisible or inaccessible?

**Create a visual presentation (format flexible):**
- Annotated image collection
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Timeline showing changes
- Failed search documentation
- Speculative reconstruction from fragments

<u>**Prepare to present your finding in class!**</u>
