# Hello Emerging Techs!

Sorry I have to introduce you to the course in these circumstances. I hope you keep warm.

My name is Shabtai Pinchevsky, and I'll be your professor for this <u>Photo Processes: Emerging Technologies course</u>!

The full syllabus for this course is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dugd4rsupPbxPrgPCxyxrUdvhMR4uMZnRnq3q3vSwNA/edit?usp=sharing). We'll go over it together next week.

This little website will be your little "home" for this course - providing guidance and resources throughout the semester. The schedule will be always up-to-date here, and you will have access to presentations, resources, and some recaps of class workshops. 

Over the next week, I'll be working on updating the syllabus to reflect the new schedule (with this first week cancelled). But this website's schedule is already slightly more updated than the syllabus.

This website will be accessible online for as long as I can keep (I wish to say forever, but who knows...). So, even when you graduate and no longer have access to Canvas, this will be here if you need it.

We will still be using Canvas for Assignment submissions, mostly.

In order not to waste valuable time, we'll still do a few things this week, asynchronously (I'm glad I can type it and not have to say this impossible word!).

1. **Read** Blaise Agüera y Arcas, [Art in the Age of Machine Intelligence](/emerging-tech-s26/files/Art-in-the-Age-of-Machine-Intelligence.pdf), 2017

2. **Submit** your reading response on [Canvas](https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1893828/assignments/14397665), due before our next class, Feb 2nd.

3. **Respond** to the [Questionnaire](https://tally.so/r/A7ByMD) so I can learn a bit about you and plan accordingly

4. **Sign-up** to [are.na](https://www.are.na/).
   1. If you are unfamiliar with Arena, it is a sort of a social network only dedicated to interesting stuff found online. It can be a real wonderful rabbit hole sometimes.
   2. After creating an account, join the course's group using [this invite link](https://www.are.na/group/emerging-tech-s26/invite/SjCHLCZTVrjXPItwZpAtXA)
   3. You can also explore some of my blocks (bookmarks) and channels (folders?) at [Photography: Emerging Technologies](https://www.are.na/shabtai-pinchevsky/photography-emerging-technologies)

**These activities are not graded, but completion will count as 'attending' for week 1.**
