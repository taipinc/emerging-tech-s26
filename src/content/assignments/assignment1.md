# Assignment 1: Procedural Photography

Write an algorithm (a procedure, set of instructions) that another person will execute to create a photographic work. Think of your algorithm as a photographic "machine" - when someone follows your instructions, they should produce a cohesive body of images or photo-based documentation.

**Requirements:**

- The instructions should fit 1 to 3 hour of duration
- Must produce a series of digital photographs
- Must include at least TWO algorithmic elements:
  - Loops (repetition with variation)
  - Conditions (if/then logic based on what's encountered)
  - Variables (elements that change based on input)

**Your procedure can utilize:**

- Available infrastructure (streets, buildings, transportation, public spaces)
- Found resources (signs, people, objects encountered)
- The executor's available devices (phone camera, notebook)

**The final work should be:**

- A series/collection of images (not a single photo)
- Connected by your procedural logic
- Something that reveals patterns, systems, or unexpected relationships?

**Safety & Ethics:**

- Don't put anyone at risk
- Respect privacy and private property
- Consider the impact on subjects and locations
