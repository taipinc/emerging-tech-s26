# Hello Emerging Techs!

Sorry we have to meet in these circumstances. I hope you keep warm.

My name is Shabtai Pinchevsky, and I'll be your professor for this <u>Photo Processes: Emerging Technologies course</u>!

---

The full syllabus for this course is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dugd4rsupPbxPrgPCxyxrUdvhMR4uMZnRnq3q3vSwNA/edit?usp=sharing). We'll go over it together next week.

This little website will be your guide and resource for the course this semester. The schedule will be always up-to-date here, and you will have access here to presentations, resources, and some recaps from class workshops.

Over the next week, I'll be working on updating the syllabus to reflect the new schedule (with this first week cancelled). But this website's schedule is already slightly more updated.

This website will be online and you'll have access to it - as long as I can keep it online (I wish to say forever, but who knows...). So, even if you graduate and no longer have access to Canvas, this will be here if you need it.

We will still be using Canvas for Assignment submissions, mostly.

In order not to waste valuable time, we'll still do a few things this week, asy... a.. assyn... asynchronously.

1. **Read** Blaise Agüera y Arcas, [Art in the Age of Machine Intelligence](/emerging-tech-s26/files/Art-in-the-Age-of-Machine-Intelligence.pdf), 2017

2. **Submit** your reading response on [Canvas](https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1893828), due before our next class, Feb 2nd.

3. **Respond** to the [Questionnaire](https://tally.so/r/A7ByMD) so I can learn a bit about you and plan accordingly

4. **Sign-up** to [are.na](https://www.are.na/).
   1. If you are unfamiliar with Arena, it is a sort of a social network only dedicated to interesting stuff found online. It can be a real wonderful rabbit hole sometimes.
   2. After creating an account, joing the course's group using [this invite link](https://www.are.na/group/emerging-tech-s26/invite/SjCHLCZTVrjXPItwZpAtXA)
   3. You can also explore some of my blocks (bookmarks) and channels (folders?) at [Photography: Emerging Technologies](https://www.are.na/shabtai-pinchevsky/photography-emerging-technologies)
