# Assignment 3: Photogrammetry

Create 3 photogrammetric scans by choosing from the prompt categories below. You may choose 3 from the same category or mix across categories. Each scan should be accompanied by brief documentation (a few sentences) explaining your choice and what you learned from the process.

### Personal/Biographical
Scan something meaningful to you:

- An object you brought from home
- Your hands, face, or body (self-documentation)
- A possession that represents a memory or relationship
- A space that is meaningful to you

### Failure
Scan something that photogrammetry struggles with:

- Highly reflective surfaces (mirrors, glass, metal)
- Transparent or translucent objects
- Moving subjects (people, animals, water)
- Very dark or very bright materials
- Fine details (hair, fabric texture, plants)
- Extreme scales (too tiny or too large)
