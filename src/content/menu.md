## Course Description

In this Photo Processes course, we will explore how contemporary technologies—from 3D imaging to generative AI—change what photographs do in the world. By looking at emerging photographic practices across experimental capture, surveillance technologies, and machine vision, you will gain the skills to make and question how images mediate our identities, relationships, and everyday experiences. Through lectures, workshops, readings, and critique, you will build a technical and critical skill set for experimenting with technologies such as 3D imaging and photogrammetry, image datasets, image‑based simulations, and accessible generative AI workflows. No technical background is required. This course emphasizes experimentation and play to engage in the image systems that influence how we're seen, categorized, and governed.
