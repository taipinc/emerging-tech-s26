# Assignment 2: Hugging Space Report

Explore [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to understand the landscape of accessible machine learning tools. Choose 2-3 spaces that interest you photographically or conceptually, experiment with them, and present your findings to the class.

**Explore!**

- Browse Hugging Face Spaces
- Test at least 5 different spaces
- Document your experiments (save outputs, take screenshots, note observations)

**Deeper Dive**

Select 3 spaces to investigate more thoroughly. For each, consider:
- What does it do?
- What are its inputs/outputs? (What does it need from you? What does it generate?)
- Where did it succeed?
- How does it fail? (Push it to its limits - what reveals the system's logic or biases?)
- Photographic potential? (How might this be used photographically or artistically?)

**Present**

Create a 5-10 minute presentation sharing your findings (showing 2-3 spaces)
